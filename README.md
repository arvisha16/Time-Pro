# Time Pro
### A macOS app where you can keep track of time with a beautiful clock and design. Made entirely with `SwiftUI`.

## Features:
* A beautiful Analog Clock

Install
-
Get Time Pro for macOS [here](https://github.com/savagegod22/Time-Pro/releases/download/v1.1/Time-Pro-v1.1.zip). Just unzip the file and drag it into your Applications folder.
When you try opening it, it will say “Time Pro” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software, but you can ignore that, because this app doesn't have a virus. To fix that, go to System Preferences, Privacy, and then General. Next, choose open anyway in the bottom. This app does not contain a virus. Enjoy!
